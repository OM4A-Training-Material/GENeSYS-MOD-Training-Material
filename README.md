# GENeSYS-MOD-Training-Material

The Global Energy System Model - or GENeSYS-MOD - is an open source cross-sectoral energy system model aimed at long-term developments of the energy system.



GENeSYS-MOD is originally based on the Open-Source Energy Modeling System (`OSeMOSYS  <http://www.osemosys.org/>`_) framework. While still part of the OSeMOSYS family of models, various aspects have been redesigned, expanded, or added. GENeSYS-MOD is a linear program, minimizing total system costs. Energy demands are exogenously predefined and the model needs to provide the necessary capacities to meet them. The modeling framework is very flexible in its use cases. Based on research question and input data, calculations can be done from a household-basis to a global aggregation of regions.

The model covers the sectors electricity, buildings, industry, and transport. It also includes all linkages between those sectors, as well as flexibility options and energy trade between regions.

A main focus of GENeSYS-MOD is to be easily understandable and usable, offering multiple model versions in the GAMS and Julia programming languages, making it available for a wide range of potential users. By offering flexible time aggregation methods, the model can be used on any kind of machine, including PCs and laptops, without the requirement for expensive hardware.

GENeSYS-MOD has been in development since 2016 and is still continuously enhanced and upgraded (see the :doc:`Release Notes </release_notes/release_notes>`). A timeline of these developments and events is shown below.
