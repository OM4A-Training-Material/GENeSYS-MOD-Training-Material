GENeSYS-MOD – Global Energy System Model
GENeSYS-MOD (Global Energy System Model) is an open-source, cross-sectoral energy system model designed for analyzing long-term developments of energy systems. It aims to be accessible, flexible, and powerful for a wide range of users and research questions.

Overview
Originally based on the OSeMOSYS framework, GENeSYS-MOD has been significantly expanded and modified. While still part of the OSeMOSYS model family, many components have been redesigned to increase functionality and usability.

GENeSYS-MOD is a linear programming model that minimizes total system costs. Energy demands are exogenously defined, and the model determines the capacities and technologies needed to meet them. The framework is flexible and can be applied to studies ranging from household-level to global-scale energy system analyses.

Key Features
